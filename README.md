It adds form validation for the Name, Email, Activities, and payment information fields. Also adds the ability
to choice a size, a design, and a shirt color based on the design you have chosen. Has the ability to choice mulitple 
workshops you can attend while attending the main conference. If a workshop is chosen, any workshops that have a schedule
conflict with the chosen workshop will be grayed out and disabled from being selected. Once that chosen workshop ios unselected,
the other was be able to be clicked again. There is also a running total of total price kept under the activities section.


Real-time error message:

Along with the normal form validation, the credit card number input field listens for a keyup event and 
provides the user with real-time feedback on whether or not the card number they are entering is valid. 


Conditional error message:

The email field provides error feedback based on the error. If the error is the email field was left empty it will inform
the user of that and if it was a formatting issues it will indicate that to the user as well.
